scripts
=======

NOTE:  I no longer maintain many of the scripts in this project as I no longer work as a Mac administator.  Please feel free to fork and modify for your own purposes.  I cannot guarantee that many of these will work as of 2018, however, they are useful for learning purposes or for pointing people in the right direction.

Scripts for sharing - useful for a Mac or Linux audience.

Many of these are used in a Mac environment managed with the JAMF Casper Suite.  However, they can be adapted as needed pretty easily.

Some of the scripts depend on cocoaDialog being installed: http://mstratman.github.io/cocoadialog/
As an alternative, I imagine /usr/bin/osascript could be used.  Or the jamfHelper tool if you are a Casper administrator.

All work with Mac OS X and/or Ubuntu Server unless otherwise indicated.
