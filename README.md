scripts
=======

Scripts for sharing - useful for a Mac or Linux audience.

Many of these are used in a Mac environment managed with the JAMF Casper Suite.  However, they can be adapted as needed pretty easily.

Some of the scripts depend on cocoaDialog being installed: http://mstratman.github.io/cocoadialog/
As an alternative, I imagine /usr/bin/osascript could be used.  Or the jamfHelper tool if you are a Casper administrator.

All work with Mac OS X and/or Ubuntu Server unless otherwise indicated.
